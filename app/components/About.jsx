                    I'm someone who loves picking up new things. I enjoy all things tech, food, sports, science, and much more. It's no wonder I make new hobbies often haha...
                </p>
                <p style={{color: 'var(--text-primary)'}}>
                    I rotate through many hobbies:
                    Tech-wise I'm thoroughly involved in my university community, I'm a VP on the DeltaHacks organizing team and a software developer lead for McMaster's Quantum Key Distribution Team.
                    Food-wise I love experiencing local food. Some of my favorites are kbbq, noodles, and burrito bowls.
                    Staying active is a must for me. You can often see me hiking, playing badminton with friends, and trying my best at rock climbing.
                    Some miscellaneous hobbies include photography and stargazing.
